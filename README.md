# QuestConverter
Imports the quests from Questie into pfQuest.


Copy !Questie.lua and pfQuest.lua from the character SavedVariables folder (/WoW/WTF/Account/\<LOGINNAME>/\<SERVER>/\<CHARNAME>/SavedVariables) into the script folder, where pfQuestConverter.js and QuestieHashes.csv lies in.
Then just run the script and copy the updated pfQuest.lua file back to the character SavedVariables folder.
